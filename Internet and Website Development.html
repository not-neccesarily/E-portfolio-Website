			The World Wide Web

			The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of all the files on the internet. The World Wide Web consists of millions of web servers that store and host the files accessible on it. The World Wide Web organizes all those files and makes them accessible by URL (Uniform Resource Locators). Those files may also be linked via hypertext or hypermedia links. The resources of the WWW can be transferred by HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, published via web servers and accessed by web browsers. Files on the WWW may be interconnected by hyperlinks. 
			The Web has made lots of information accessible to users via websites and webpages. They are made of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) which can be displayed easily by a web browser. Webpages are all stringed together to form a website by a common domain name. Since the invention of the World Wide Web, it has become much easier to access information from all around the globe.

			You may be wondering how the web works? First let’s start off with web servers
			Web Servers are computers that store and transmit the files available on the dark web. For example, when you are viewing a website you are just viewing a HTML file stored on another computer. This computer would be a web server and its sole purpose is to store files and transmit them over the internet. Below is an image of a web server. Most of these web servers are machines dedicated to just storing and transmitting data meaning they don’t look like normal computers and don’t have keyboards or screens.
